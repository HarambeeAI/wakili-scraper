# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Store MD workspaces as text rows in `agent_workspaces` table (not filesystem) — web app has no OS filesystem
- Single `heartbeat-dispatcher` cron (not per-agent crons) — pg_cron has limited concurrent job slots
- Fixed 12-agent catalog for v1 — ships faster with better quality defaults than freeform creation
- HEARTBEAT_OK suppression: no DB write on suppressed runs — reduces DB writes ~90% on quiet days
- Agent Team Selector at onboarding tail-end (Step 12) — users are most engaged right after finishing onboarding
- [Phase 01-database-foundation]: TEXT PK on available_agent_types to avoid ALTER TYPE issues with existing agent_type ENUM
- [Phase 01-database-foundation]: No INSERT policy on agent_heartbeat_log for authenticated users — service role only for audit integrity

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Phase 4 pre-planning:** Per-user daily heartbeat budget enforcement mechanism needs a decision before Phase 4 begins (counter column vs aggregate query vs pgmq metadata token bucket)
- **Phase 5 pre-planning:** Morning briefing per-user timezone scheduling strategy — pg_cron is UTC-only; need to decide on timezone-bucket approach vs per-user next-run timestamp
- **Phase 3 pre-planning:** HEARTBEAT.md checklist grammar must be defined before building the format validator in the workspace editor
